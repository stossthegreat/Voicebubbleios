**Commit:** `2bcb76f` - Complete transformation of dating and viral content generation

---

## 🎯 THE PROBLEM (BEFORE)

### Dating Presets Were:
- ❌ Generic and cutesy ("half angelic, half accidentally-chaotic")
- ❌ Only 2-3 weak examples
- ❌ No specific frameworks
- ❌ Temperature too high (0.95 = inconsistent)
- ❌ Missing personalization depth
- ❌ No push-pull dynamics
- ❌ Theory-based, not tested patterns

### Social Presets Were:
- ❌ Too philosophical/vague
- ❌ Weak hooks
- ❌ No platform optimization
- ❌ Missing dopamine pacing
- ❌ No viral frameworks
- ❌ Theory instead of proven patterns

## ⚡ THE SOLUTION (AFTER)

### 🔥 DATING — OPENER (20+ Elite Examples)

**New Framework:**
```
OBSERVATION (shows you looked)
    ↓
ASSUMPTION (playful, slightly wrong)
    ↓
QUESTION/CHALLENGE (easy reply path)
```

**Psychology Integration:**

- ✅ Easy-to-respond format (1-3 sentences)

**Temperature:** 0.88 (optimized for consistency + creativity)

**Example Quality Jump:**

BEFORE:
> "Your vibe is half angelic, half accidentally-chaotic. I'm trying to guess which side wins — care to help me out?"

AFTER:
> "You look like the type who knows the best coffee spot after a hike but gatekeeps it from everyone. Am I getting added to the list or nah?"

**20+ Examples Include:**

AFTER:
> "Most people aren't procrastinating.\n\nThey're terrified of being seen trying.\n\nBecause if you never start, you never fail.\nAnd if you never fail, you stay safe.\n\nBut safe = stuck.\n\nThe moment you realize failure is just feedback, everything changes.\n\nStart messy. Fail fast. Adjust.\n\nThat's how you win."
