# 🔧 FIXES APPLIED - SUMMARY

## ✅ FIX #1: EXAMPLE ALWAYS VISIBLE

**PROBLEM:** Example was hidden when recording started  
**SOLUTION:** Added example box ABOVE the voice recording box

**NOW:**
```
Question: "What's the meeting about?"

[Perfect Example Box - ALWAYS VISIBLE]
"Weekly product sync on Tuesday, October 15th..."

[Voice Recording Box Below]
🔴 Recording... 5s
```

The example NEVER disappears. It's always right there above the mic.

## ✅ FIX #2: OUTPUT FORMAT

The template creates proper markdown in fallback:

```markdown
# Meeting Notes

## Meeting Information
[extracted info]

## Attendees
[list of people]

## Priorities  
[key topics]

## Action Items
[tasks with owners]

## Notes
[additional context]
```

---

## 🎯 USER FLOW NOW:

1. Tap template
2. See question + example (ALWAYS VISIBLE)
3. Tap "I'm Ready" → starts recording immediately
4. Example STAYS VISIBLE while recording
5. Speak your answer
6. Tap stop
7. Move to next question
8. After all questions → creates formatted note
9. Note appears in Library

---

## 📝 THE EXAMPLE IS ALWAYS THERE

**Before recording:**
- Question
- Example ← VISIBLE

**While recording:**
- Question  
- Example ← STILL VISIBLE
- Voice box ← Recording here

**You NEVER have to memorize the question!**
